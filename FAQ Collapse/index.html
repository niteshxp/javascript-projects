                Explain the difference between cookies, session storage, and local storage?
            </h3>

            <p class="box-text">
                Cookies, session storage, and local storage are all mechanisms for storing data in a web browser, but
                they have some
                differences: </p>
            <p class="box-text">
                Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored in a text file on the user's computer by the web
                browser. They can be
                used to store information such as login credentials or preferences, and they are sent back to the server
                with each
                request. Cookies have a size limit of 4KB and are usually used to store data that is needed on the
                server, such as
                session identifiers.
            </p>

            <p class="box-text">Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored in a text file on the user's computer

                server, such as
                session identifiers.</p>

            <p class="box-text">Session storage is a type of storage that is specific to a single browser tab or window.
                It allows you to store data
                that is only needed for the duration of the user's session, such as the contents of a shopping cart.
                Session storage is
                stored in memory and is deleted when the user closes the tab or window.</p>

            <p class="box-text">Local storage is similar to session storage, but it persists even when the user closes
                the tab or window. Local storage
                is stored in a separate file on the user's computer and has a larger size limit than cookies (typically
                5MB or more).
                Local storage is typically used to store data that needs to be available even when the user is not
                actively using the
                site, such as saved preferences or settings.</p>
            <p class="box-text">In summary, cookies are used to store data that is needed on the server, while session
                storage and local
                storage are
                used to store data that is needed on the client (web browser). Session storage is specific to a single
                tab
                or window and
                is deleted when the user closes it, while local storage is persistent and is not deleted when the user
                closes the tab or
                window.</p>

                What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?
            </h3>

            <p class="box-text">
                CORS stands for "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing". It is a security feature implemented by web browsers
                that blocks web
                pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
            </p>
            <p class="box-text">
                For example, if a web page served from example.com makes a request to api.example.net, the browser will
                block the
                request by default, because api.example.net is a different domain than example.com. This is known as the
                "same-origin
                policy".
            </p>

            <p class="box-text">
                CORS addresses this issue by allowing web servers to specify a list of domains that are allowed to make
                requests to the
                server. When a web page makes a request to a server with CORS enabled, the browser will check the
                server's list of
                allowed domains before deciding whether to block the request.
            </p>

                Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?
            </h3>

            <p class="box-text">
                Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation are two approaches to web design that focus on ensuring
                that a web site
                is accessible and functional for all users, regardless of the capabilities of their device or web
                browser.</p>
            <p class="box-text">Progressive enhancement is a design approach that starts with a basic, functional web
                page and then adds
                additional
                layers of functionality and design on top of it, using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and
                JavaScript. The
                idea behind progressive enhancement is that all users should be able to access the core content and
                functionality of the
                site, even if they are using an older or less capable device or browser.</p>

            <p class="box-text">Graceful degradation, on the other hand, is a design approach that starts with a
                feature-rich,
                visually-appealing web
                page and then accommodates for older or less capable devices or browsers by removing or simplifying
                features as needed.
                The idea behind graceful degradation is that users with newer or more capable devices or browsers will
                have a better
                experience, while users with older or less capable devices or browsers will still be able to access the
                core content and
                functionality of the site.</p>

            <p class="box-text">
                Both progressive enhancement and graceful degradation are aimed at ensuring that a web site is
                accessible and functional
                for all users, but they approach this goal in different ways. Progressive enhancement focuses on
                building up from a
                basic foundation, while graceful degradation focuses on starting with a more advanced foundation and
                then simplifying as
                needed.

                Explain event delegation.
            </h3>

            <p class="box-text">
                Event delegation is a technique for listening for events on multiple elements, even if they are added to
                the page
                dynamically after the page has loaded. It involves setting up a single event listener on a parent
                element, and then
                using the `event.target` property to determine which child element the event actually occurred on.
            </p>
            <p class="box-text">
                Event delegation is useful because it allows you to avoid setting up separate event listeners for each
                child element.
                This can be particularly useful when you have a large number of elements, or when the elements are
                dynamically added to
                the page after the page has loaded.
            </p>

                When building a new web site or maintaining one, can you explain some techniques you have used to
                increase performance?
            </h3>

            <p class="box-text">
                There are many techniques that can be used to increase the performance of a web site. Here are a few
                examples:</p>

            <p class="box-text">
                Optimize images: Large images can take a long time to load, so it is important to optimize them for the
                web. This can be
                done by compressing the images and using the appropriate image file format (such as JPEG for photographs
                and PNG for
                graphics with transparent backgrounds).</p>
            <p class="box-text">Use a content delivery network (CDN): A CDN is a network of servers that are used to
                deliver content to
                users based on
                their geographic location. Using a CDN can reduce the load on the server and improve the speed at which
                content is
                delivered to users.</p>

            <p class="box-text">Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML: Minification is the process of removing unnecessary
                characters from
                code, such as
                whitespace and comments. Minifying CSS, JavaScript, and HTML can reduce the size of the code and improve
                the speed at
                which it is loaded.</p>
            <p class="box-text">Use asynchronous loading for JavaScript: JavaScript files can block the rendering of a
                page if they are
                loaded
                synchronously. To improve performance, it is best to load JavaScript files asynchronously, so that they
                do not block the
                rendering of the page.</p>
            <p class="box-text">Use caching: Caching can help to improve the performance of a web site by storing
                frequently-used
                resources in the
                browser's cache. This allows the resources to be loaded more quickly on subsequent visits to the site.
            </p>
            <p class="box-text">Use a performance monitoring tool: Performance monitoring tools such as Lighthouse or
                PageSpeed Insights
                can help to
                identify performance issues and suggest ways to fix them.</p>
            <p class="box-text">Optimize the server: The performance of a web site can also be improved by optimizing
                the server on
                which it is running.
                This can involve tuning the server's configuration, using a faster server hardware, or implementing
                caching on the
                server.</p>
